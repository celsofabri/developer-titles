# Developer Titles

`['fictional', 'awesome', 'random', 'funny', 'obsolete']` developer titles :tada:


## :scroll: About
After years viewing crazy job and developer titles on social media, I've decided to merge them in a single website.


## :gem: Stack
This site is create using [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/) (ES6) and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). It uses [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I like to use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) as the package manager, but feel free to use wether you want (npm || yarn).

> Oh but why not creating it with React or Vue?
>> Because I didn't want to :smile:


## :pencil: Contributing
If you want to add some titles, follow the steps below:

- Fork the repo
- Create a new branch
- Do the work
- Fill a PR, assign it to you and, if possible, write a cool description
- Wait for the review

After that, if your request doesn't offend anyone, your title will be able to be part of the great array.

**Don't be afraid to fill some issues, if you want! :heart:**

> For the colors, I like to use [colorion](http://colorion.co).

If you're only looking for the titles, [here they are](https://github.com/jlozovei/developer-titles/blob/master/src/data/titles.json). :rocket:


## :warning: Disclaimer
The goal here is to have fun. Don't use it to be a jerk on other people's work/job!
